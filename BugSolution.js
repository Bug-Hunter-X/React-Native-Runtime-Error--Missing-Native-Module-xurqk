Ensure that the native modules you're using are correctly installed and linked within your React Native project. This may involve running specific commands such as `react-native link` or using a build system like CocoaPods (for iOS) or Gradle (for Android). Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and that there aren't any conflicts between different versions of the modules.  If you have recently updated your project, consider cleaning and rebuilding the project to ensure the latest changes are properly incorporated.
